/*
  Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it.
  
  Your tasks:
  1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
  2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
  
  Hint: Use an if/else statement ðŸ˜‰
  
  GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
